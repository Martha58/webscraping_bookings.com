# Project Overview

Booking.com is a dynamically built website with stringent anti-scraping measures, presenting significant challenges for data extraction. This ongoing project is designed to demonstrate my web scraping expertise by developing a solution that extracts detailed hotel information from Booking.com.

The process begins by scraping a list of hotel links from the main search results pages. The solution then loops through each individual link to extract comprehensive hotel details, including names, locations, amenities, prices, ratings, and reviews. Given the dynamic nature of Booking.comâ€™s content, the scraper is designed to handle JavaScript-rendered elements and navigate through complex page structures to ensure accurate and complete data extraction.

The end goal of this project is to save the collected data into a relational database, where it can be efficiently stored and queried. Additionally, I plan to use DBT (Data Build Tool) to transform and organize the raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format. Once transformed, the dataset will serve as the foundation for analytical workflows, providing actionable insights into hotel trends and performance.

Although the primary objective of this project is to showcase my web scraping capabilities, it also highlights my ability to integrate data extraction processes with modern data engineering tools like relational databases and DBT. This end-to-end approach reflects a robust skill set in data acquisition, transformation, and preparation for analytics.
